					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] In the event of, for example a terrorist attack, situational awareness would be caring for all injured parties and applying damage control procedure. It’s there in the moment. Situational understanding on the other hand is the perception of the global situation. For example in a terrorist attack, it isn’t a ‘simple’ shooting incident; therefore after the shooting, some areas may still be dangerous, and terrorists may be present even after the attack. Situational awareness is knowing how to care for victims with severe trauma and applying damage control principles, while situational understanding is about knowing the severity of the situation (Vivian 2018). Situational understanding requires a combination of insight and foresight i.e. the ability to accurately perceive an existing situation and the ability to anticipate how an existing situation may develop in the future (Trost 2016).
